## Panoramic Scene Viewer ActiveX


</div>

### Description

I have not seen anything like this on this web site or any other for that matter. It is a 3D Scene Panoramic Viewer ActiceX Control(Source Code). This is a stripped down version of another control I am working on, but it functions well. I have included a test project for the control. Load the group project to see the control working. I have also included a panoramic Image. the Image is not mine and I forgot where I got it. You can use any panoramic graphic you want, just change the path in the test project to point to your image. Also don't forget to view the Read Me file included. And if you like the code Please Vote. Any questions just email me and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
